# Xlax Guilded
Xlax XLAXON is on Guilded now?
Actually, being unhappy of Discord, Xlax XLAXON decided by himself to move to [Guilded](https://guilded.gg/xlax)

# Setup requirements
To run **guildedxlax**, you'll need to create a .env file containing the following

``` 
GUILDED_TOKEN=ur-guilded-token-yay
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-yay
```

Also, you will need the **guilded.py** and **openai** libraires. 

```
pip install guilded.py
pip install openai
```

With the following commands, Xlax XLAXON should run. Also, the allowed channel id present in the code is the one for *The Xlax Clan*, if you want it to run on your own, you'll need to change it.
